Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-Using-CNN-RESENT-SENET-OPENVINO-and-DLIB

This project, titled "Driver Drowsiness Detection Using CNN, Resnet, SEnet, 
OpenVino and Dlib" is an application built using Python and different machine learning 
models. It aims to determine drowsiness of a driver using the facial information 
obtained from camera and alert if driver is drowsy. The face, a crucial part of the body, 
conveys significant information, especially during fatigue. For instance, facial 
expressions such as the frequency of blinking and yawning differ from those in a normal 
state. Additionally, we explored whether incorporating data such as head nodding 
improves the accuracy of drowsiness detection and prediction. To achieve this, we 
employed various models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), ResNet, 
and SENet. To address the limitations of these models, we also developed a custom 
algorithm integrated with an OpenVINO model and Dlib library. This approach 
enhances the detection and prediction capabilities. Upon detecting drowsiness, the 
system alerts the driver with a beep sound, continuing until the driver's is back to non
drowsy state.
